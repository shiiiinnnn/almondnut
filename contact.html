      <h3>Illustration Production Request Process</h3>
      <p>The illustration request process begins with the client submitting a clear brief, including details like style preferences, color schemes, and any specific elements they'd like included. Once the brief is reviewed, the artist and client discuss the timeline, budget, and deliverables. After agreeing on these terms, the artist creates preliminary sketches or concepts for the client's approval. Upon approval, the artist moves on to refining and adding details, periodically sharing progress updates. Finally, the completed illustration is delivered in the specified formats, with any minor revisions as requested by the client.</p>

      <h3>Regarding commercial use of personal illustrations</h3>
      <p>For illustrations intended for commercial use, it's essential to establish clear terms regarding licensing and usage rights upfront. The artist and client should discuss the scope of the intended use, such as in advertisements, merchandise, or digital platforms, and define the duration and geographic reach of the usage rights. Pricing for commercial illustrations is typically higher, reflecting the added value of extended use and exclusivity. Once terms are agreed upon, they're documented in a formal agreement or contract to ensure clarity and protect both parties' interests. The artist then provides the client with the final files, along with any required licensing documentation.</p>
